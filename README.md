# I3D

This repository uses specific video sets to evaluate the performance of two-stream I3D against visual challenges (as an example rapid display of images!)

The i3d code used here is inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/piergiaj/pytorch-i3d/blob/master/pytorch_i3d.py) with some minor changes.
